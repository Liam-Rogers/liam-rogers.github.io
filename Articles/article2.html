           if like me, you spend a lot of time in one room for both study and socialising with a great interest in tech and computers alike, you'll likely
           find yourself with a server for either running passion projects, game servers, the options are really endless. However, there is one caveat to a lot of servers out there:
           NOISE! understandably from a real-world use case it wouldnt be much of a focal point because they're supposed to be stacked floor to ceiling in a warehouse with appropriate ventilation.
           Not in a home setting. So, me being me wanting to force something to have a function it wasnt meant to have, make it work!
        </p>
        <h2>Software Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
           For the purpose of this guide, i will follow you through my steps with a Dell PowerEdge R210. You will first need to head to Dell's website to find the suitable drivers and software for your machine
           using the search query box you want to search for Dell OpenManage BMC Utility. This contains the neccesary software for you to locally and remotely interact with your server for a multitude of functions.
           Once downloaded run the .EXE and 
        </p>

        <a href="https://dl.dell.com/FOLDER04161746M/1/OM-BMC-Dell-Web-WIN-8.5.0-2372_A00.exe" style="color: aqua; text-decoration: underline; "> Download Link to Dell R210 BMC Utility V8.5 </a>

        <h2>Interfacing with the server: Lets make a script!</h2>
        <p>Now we have the software installed, you will want to open the notepad so we can make a script to execute. it should look like the following:</p>
        <p>cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Dell\SysMgt\bmc</p>
        <p>ipmitool -I lanplus -H (your IP goes here) -U root -P calvin raw 0x30 0x30 0x01 0x00</p>
        <p>ipmitool -I lanplus -H (your IP goes here) -U root -P calvin raw 0x30 0x30 0x02 0xff 0x10</p>
        <p>pause</p>

        <p>the default user and password credentials for the idrac are root and calvin respectively, if you have changed them replace as needed. The function of this code: the second line allows the fan to be controlled, the third line is where you can manually set a static fan speed using hex
            specifically the last hex character "0x10". Changing the last two charaters lower or higher correspond with increased or decreased fan speeds which should update immedialty as the command is executed.
        </p>

        <p>You then want to save it as something.bat and under and type: 'all files'. you can then click to open it and it will tell you if there is any connection issues and if the code has executed. if you want it to automatically close, just remove the pause.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Maybe this article helped you, if so i am glad! enjoy no longer having to wear safety ear muffs in close proximity ðŸ˜†
            Thanks for reading and have a great day!</p>
