    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how I, as the sole developer of this website, collect, use, and protect your information. Transparency is important to me, and this page outlines my use of Google Analytics and the limited data it gathers.</p>

    <h2>Information I Collect</h2>

    <p>This website uses Google Analytics via the Global Site Tag (GTAG) to monitor website traffic and gather basic insights. The data collected includes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Traffic data:</strong> Number of visitors and pages viewed.</li>
        <li><strong>Geolocation information:</strong> General location data, such as country or region, inferred from your IP address.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and browser information:</strong> Information about the type of device, browser, and operating system used.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All data collected through Google Analytics is <strong>anonymized</strong> where possible, including the anonymization of IP addresses, so no personally identifiable information (PII) is recorded.</p>

    <h2>How I Use the Information</h2>

    <p>I use this information solely for the purpose of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Understanding website traffic patterns.</li>
        <li>Improving the user experience and optimizing content.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The data is <strong>not shared</strong> with any third parties except for Google Analytics, which processes the data on my behalf. For more details on how Google processes this data, refer to their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

    <p>Google Analytics uses cookies to collect data. These are small files stored on your device to help understand how you interact with the website. The cookies used include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> Track user behavior on the site (e.g., which pages are visited).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can manage or disable cookies in your browser settings. However, this website does not provide its own mechanism for opting out of tracking or analytics cookies. To disable Google Analytics tracking, you can use your browser settings or tools like Google’s opt-out mechanism. Visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google’s opt-out page</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>

    <p>If you are visiting this site from a region governed by privacy regulations like the GDPR (EU/UK ) or CCPA (California), you have the following rights:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>To know what data is collected and how it’s used.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please note that I do not store or control data directly collected via Google Analytics. Historical data is available through Google’s tools, and users can manage their tracking preferences through browser settings or Google’s opt-out options.</p>

    <p>If you have additional questions about data handling, please contact me using the information below.</p>
