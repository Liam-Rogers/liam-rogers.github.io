        <p>In the dynamic realm of machine learning, a robust and high-quality dataset serves as the bedrock for training algorithms to achieve remarkable results. Meet ClassifyML: the app that simplifies the process of creating specialized image datasets, propelling your machine learning training endeavors to new heights. Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist or a curious enthusiast, ClassifyML’s intuitive features and seamless user experience are set to redefine the way you handle image data.

            One of ClassifyML’s standout features is its ability to streamline the creation of accurate and well-defined bounding boxes. These bounding boxes are crucial for training algorithms to understand the spatial relationships within images. With a user-friendly interface, you can effortlessly draw bounding boxes around objects of interest, ensuring that your dataset captures the essence of your training objectives.
      
            Key Features at a Glance:
            
                Import images effortlessly from your device’s file manager.
                Capture images on the fly using the integrated on-device camera.
                Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for rapid dataset assembly.
                Precision bounding box creation for accurate object delineation.
                Export images and JSON files in a structured folder for easy integration into existing ML training apps such as Apple’s CreateML
                Apple Pen Support (iPad app only)
